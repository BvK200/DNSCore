### Ingest 

The following chapter describes manual ingestion of SIP. Automatic ingestion is possible via the 
internal interface of CB. Please refer to CB's documentation. 

#### Manual ingestion of SIP 

The manual ingestion on SIP relies on features which must be provided by our node administrators.
In case of WEBDAV/SFTP or other transport layers your node admin has to provide adequate 
space for having something like an ingest bay for incoming packages. 
While having no semafor or monitor to check for complete transmission of packages yet, users 
have to start their delivered packages manually.  


### Retrieval 

Requested Packages are visible a) on the stored Objects view b) in the outgoing folder of Contractor.
