","body":"DNSCore\r\n=======\r\n\r\nThe Core System of the DA-NRW Software Suite. \r\nThe DNS software relies\r\nexclusively on existing open source software components to implement a\r\ndistributed, self-validating repository, allowing depositors a high degree of control over\r\nthe methods applied to individual objects submitted for preservation and\r\ndistribution.\r\n\r\nFor Documentation see:\r\n* the [wiki](wiki)\r\n* the [Java API documentation](http://da-nrw.github.io/DNSCore/apidocs/)\r\n\r\n### Feature list\r\n\r\nAs a result of various research programs in the recent years there are some \r\nsoftware solutions available which handle preservation tasks. Since each of\r\nthese solutions was designed under a different focus and to solve different sets of\r\nproblems within the field of longterm preservation, it is worth mentioning\r\nthe two most distinctive features of DNSCore at first, before diving in into\r\na richer feater list.\r\n\r\n#### Distinctive Features\r\n\r\nThe first big feature is the possibility for users to let the system automatically\r\ngenerate derivates of your material destined for long term preservation which are\r\nsuited for online web presentation. The decision to integrate a presentation component\r\ndeep into the core of the software was originally politically motivated as it was\r\na state financed open source project and the idea to let the general public have a share\r\non cultural material accumulated in a state wide archive was only natural in the context of\r\nthis background. Also due to the technical possibilities of the digital domain it is relatively\r\neasy to do so and give users access to this material in an easy and uncomplicated way and\r\nthis seems contemporary because users nowadays are used to get the information they want\r\nas they are used to it in everyday internet life anyway. We think of it as a really great\r\nfeature.\r\n\r\nWhile implementing this feature there was some confusion when speaking of DIPs as stated \r\nin the OAIS reference model as DIPs can designate any material accessed by the users of\r\nsuch a system and the DIPs accessed from the long term component differ a lot from those\r\naccessed via the presentation component. As a consequence we decided to reflect these\r\ndistinctions in a concise way in order to make communication easier. So we introduced\r\nthe concept of PIPs (Presentation Information Package) into our model, which is an\r\nextension to the OAIS model specifically targeted at our needs.\r\n\r\nThe second big feature is the so called [Delta-Feature](https://github.com/da-nrw/DNSCore/blob/master/ContentBroker/src/main/markdown/the_delta_feature.md). With deltas users can make additions\r\nto contents already present in the long term archive. This feature is also deeply integrated\r\ninto the basic architecture of the software. Also it needed to create an object model that is\r\nin line with the OAIS reference model but is more complicated in its specifics since the\r\nsoftware must handle the organization of objects and packages in the background. So when we\r\nspeak of an object in the context of DNSCore as our main entity in the object model, we have\r\na unit of data which can consist of data of more than one package/SIP at the same time. \r\n\r\n#### Other Features\r\n\r\n* DAWeb - Graphical user interface for administrators and users\r\n* Storage Layer - geographical distribution/replication of data\r\n* Audit\r\n* Format identification\r\n* Codec identification\r\n* Automatic format conversion\r\n\r\nTo build streamlined SIP based based on the used SIP specifications, take a look at:\r\n\r\n* SIPBuilder - Graphical user interface for End-Users, which allows high degree control over \r\nSIP submitted to the DNS. The software could be easily integrated in subsystems, due to having \r\na command line interface.\r\n\r\nFor deeper information on the software please take a look at the Wiki on GitHub.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
