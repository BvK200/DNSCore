SIP-Builder
===========

# A tool 
## for automated 
### SIP creation 
#### providing both a 
##### graphical and a command line interface.

The [SIP-Builder](https://github.com/da-nrw/DNSCore/tree/master/SIP-Builder) is a Java tool capable of creating SIPs and collections that adhere to the structure explained above. The tool can be used in two modes:
* In GUI __mode__, the **user** is led through a number of consecutive steps in order to determine the data and rights settings. This mode is meant primarily for unexperienced users and users who want to process a rather small amount of data. It can also be used to create the contract rights in a comfortable way.
* In CLI mode, the necessary settings are handed over to the application as command line parameters. This mode is useful for integrating the SIP-Builder into automated processes.

A German manual explaining the steps in GUI mode and all of the possible parameters in CLI mode can be found here
