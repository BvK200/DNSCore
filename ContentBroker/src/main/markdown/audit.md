## Audit 

In order to ensure the bitstream preservation of the stored AIP, checksums are stored for each stored AIP and automatically checked in periodic intervals. 
An AIP is only valid in terms of DNS, when is stored at least at three nodes and has identical checksums on all hosts. 
This is checked on Retrieval, too. 

### Automatic Audit

On each node

### Manual Audit
