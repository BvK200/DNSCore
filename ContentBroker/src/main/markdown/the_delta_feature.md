# The delta mechanism

Users who want to use the delta mechanism should be accustomed how the concepts
of [objects](https://github.com/da-nrw/DNSCore/blob/master/ContentBroker/src/main/markdown/object_model.md#object) 
and [packages](https://github.com/da-nrw/DNSCore/blob/master/ContentBroker/src/main/markdown/object_model.md#package) 
relate to each other in the context of the DNSCore software.

TODO description what deltas are 

TODO orig name and identifier

When working with deltas it is necessary to understand which implication this has. Therefore
users in using the delta feature should read at least the paragraph about 
[substitution rules](https://github.com/da-nrw/DNSCore/blob/master/ContentBroker/src/main/markdown/dip_specification.md#substitution-rules-and-surface-view-of-an-object) 
carefully.
