# Administration - Interface Reference 

While we have an administration and user frontend called DA-Web which lets users (end users and administrators) interact in a dynamic manner, there are several configuration options of DNSCore which are considered static properties of the system. They are configured in the old fashioned way of good old configuration files which can be edited with your good old favorite linux editor. Easy! 

These artefacts comprise the interface to the ContentBroker with which administrators must learn to deal with in order to configure and run a proper node of a DNSCore based system. The document is structed in that way that each configuration file is described extensively in its own passage.

**Note** that for the purporse of the discussion of this document, we call the ContentBroker installation directory ${CB_HOME}

**Note** that, as the interfaces can change from time to time, in doubt you should look at the right version of this document. Go to the releases page and you'll find the source tree for this specific version.

## Application module configuration

${CB_HOME}/conf/beans.xml

Depending on the mode of installation (f,p,n) the beans.xml can look a little different respectively. However here are described the building blocks which comprise the beans.xml:

### The General params section 

#### Ingest Gate

The IngestGate is a special feature which was designed with the purpose of protecting the [WorkArea](processing_stages.md#WorkArea)'s file system from overflow. The ContentBroker's workflow engine recieves orders from various other components that always have the consequence that data from different resources must be fetched to the WorkArea. There the data get unpacked, processed and repacked.

Example from [beans.xml.full](../xml/beans.xml.full)

	<bean class="de.uzk.hki.da.core.IngestGate" id="ingestGate">
		<property name="workAreaRootPath" value="${localNode.workAreaRootPath}" />
		<property name="fileSizeFactor" value="3" />
		<property name="freeDiskSpacePercent" value="5" />
	</bean>

The workAreaRootPath is set automatically to the correspoding variable from config.properties so you don't have to take care of that.

    <property name="freeDiskSpacePercent" value="5" />

This is the value an administrator has to consider setting right for his machine. It defines how many percent of the WorkArea's file system have to be vacant in order to allow the ContentBroker to touch new jobs and fetch the corresponding packages from the IngestArea or long term resources to unpack and process them. When setting up a new node, a good value to start could be 50. When gained a little bit of experience with the ContentBroker on the particular machine, the value later can be refined. 

    <property name="fileSizeFactor" value="3" />

This value is tweakable, but does not depend on the machine but on the workflow and the packages' data. A value of 3 means that it is expected that an incoming package gets (during the Ingest workflow) bloated temporarily to three times its original size. Usually let the value as it is and only modify it when you have strong evidence that overflows of the file system occur due to huge package sizes.

#### Worker scheduler

Example from [beans.xml.full](../xml/beans.xml.full)

	<task:executor id="taskExecutor" pool-size="10"
		queue-capacity="20" rejection-policy="CALLER_RUNS" />
	<task:scheduled-tasks scheduler="taskScheduler">
		<task:scheduled ref="contentBroker" method="scheduleTask" fixed-delay="200" />
		<task:scheduled ref="ingestAreaScannerWorker" method="scheduleTask" fixed-delay="1000" />
		<task:scheduled ref="userAreaScannerWorker" method="scheduleTask" fixed-delay="1000" />
		<task:scheduled ref="integrityScannerWorker" method="scheduleTask" fixed-delay="20000" />
	</task:scheduled-tasks>
	<task:scheduler id="taskScheduler" pool-size="20" />

The ContentBroker has a scheduling mechanism which starts worker threads periodically.


### The action engine related settings

Example from [beans.xml.full](../xml/beans.xml.full)

	<util:map id="actionThreads">
		<entry key="DeleteObjectAction" value="3" />
		<entry key="RestartIngestWorkflowAction" value="3" />
		<entry key="IngestRegisterURNAction" value="3" />
		...
		<entry key="PIPGenObjectToWorkAreaAction" value="3" />
		<entry key="PIPGenCleanWorkAreaAction" value="3" />
	</util:map>

	<util:list id="actionOrdering">
   		<value>DeleteObjectAction</value>
		<value>RestartIngestWorkflowAction</value>
		<value>RetrievalAction</value>
		...
		<value>PIPGenScanForPresentationAction</value>
		<value>PIPGenObjectToWorkAreaAction</value>
        <value>PostRetrievalAction</value>
	</util:list>

### The import secion

    <!-- beans.xml.full -->

    <import resource="classpath*:META-INF/beans-infrastructure.common.xml"/>
    <import resource="classpath*:META-INF/beans-infrastructure.identifier.xml"/>
    <import resource="classpath*:META-INF/beans-infrastructure.fedora.xml"/>
    <import resource="classpath*:META-INF/beans-infrastructure.irods.xml"/>

    <import resource="classpath*:META-INF/beans-workflow.presentation.xml"/>
    <import resource="classpath*:META-INF/beans-workflow.ingest.xml"/>
    <import resource="classpath*:META-INF/beans-workflow.retrieval.xml"/>
    <import resource="classpath*:META-INF/beans-workflow.pipgen.xml"/>
    <import resource="classpath*:META-INF/beans-workflow.other.xml"/>

You'll typically find this section at the top of a beans.xml file. When installing the application, the installer delivers it with a beans.xml which has the right imports for your version (node,pres,full). The imports activate certain components of the application which would be inactive otherwise. When the imports are active the application requires the presence of certain properties in the config.properties file, dependent on the modules activated. Compare the parameters section above.

## Application logging

DNSCore uses log4j extensively to present the output of the application in a meaningful, consistent and easy to debug manner.

### Basic logging

Before we consider the application specific logging, let us first point out that there are two logfiles which capture the basic output of the java command. In case your ContentBroker doesn't start, have a look at the content of these files.

    ${CB_HOME}/log/stderr.log
    
The stderr output from the execution of the java command started via nohup in ContentBroker.sh. Gets created on startup. Gets overwritten completely every time the ContentBroker gets restarted. **Note** that if this file has content but it doesn't change from startup to startup, it is the stderr from the last run. After a proper run the file always should be empty.

    ${CB_HOME}/log/stdout.log
    
The stdout output from the execution of the java command started via nohup in ContentBroker.sh. Gets created on startup. Gets overwritten completely every time the ContentBroker gets restarted.

### Application specific configuration - default behaviour

The ContentBroker finds its logging configuration at

    ${CB_HOME}/conf/logback.xml
 
The file automatically gets installed by the installer. Without this file beeing present, the ContentBroker would theoretically work, but without useful logging. By the usage of this file, the ContentBroker configures itself to log into several files. These are described below

    ${CB_HOME}/log/contentbroker.log
    
This logger outputs information about the workings of the base system, which is responsible for fetching jobs from the database and making actions out of them. The business code of the actions itself gets logged by other loggers. Also setup of the ContentBroker is logged here, why it is usually a good idea to start looking here if the ContentBroker seems not to start properly.

    ${CB_HOME}/log/ingest.log
    
This logger provides information coming from the IngestScannerWorker, the component which scans the [IngestArea](processing_stages.md#ingestarea)s contractor folders for incoming SIP packages. If wonder why there are packages in the IngestArea and the ContentBroker doesn't fetch them, this file is one of the most obvious places to start debugging.

    ${CB_HOME}/log/grid.log
    
The grid log provides information about from the package grid. 
    
    ${CB_HOME}/log/object-logs
    
TODO describe

**Note** that it is also possible to override the default settings by modifying the logback.xml. This is for experimental purposes only. The logback.xml gets automatically overwritten by the installer on every update of the application so all changes will be lost after an update.


### cbTalk

In the ContentBroker HOME directory, you find a command line tool called 

    cbTalk.sh 
    
This is a wrapper Tool connecting to the Active MQ Broker, CB establishes while starting. 

Stopping CB`s main factory, useful when restarting CB. CB will perform any operations to their dedicated end state, but won't perform any newly created queue entries. This preserves CB from any inconsitencies while performing operations on SIP. 

    ./cbTalk.sh STOP_FACTORY
    
Starting CB`s main factory

     ./cbTalk.sh START_FACTORY
     
Graceful stopping factory, same as STOP_FACTORY but tries to exit the running JVM. (This feature is experimental, Admins should always ensure to kill CB'S proc after executing coammand)

     ./cbTalk.sh GRACEFUL_SHUTDOWN

Show Version of CB 
     
     ./cbTalk.sh SHOW_VERSION

Show running Actions of working CB

     ./cbTalk.sh SHOW_ACTIONS 
     
Same operations could be carried out via DAWeb
