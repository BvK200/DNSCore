# Accepted Metadata formats of DNS

There are several metadata formats that the DNS Suite will accept in SIPs.
Though basically any binary and metadata format will be subject to long term preservation in DNSCore,
these formats which we call "accepted" garantuee that the PIPs generated in a side workflow will
be properly processed for access by viewers. 

At the moment we accept four formats:

* METS/MODS
* EAD - with METS
* LIDO
* XMP - Sidecar

## METS/MODS

## EAD - with METS
