# Ingest and Retrieval



## Retrieval 

Once you have ingested a package into the system successfully, which you know by
recieving an email report for the object, you can search the system for it and retrieve
it. How this is done is described by the following steps

#### Retrieval step by step

1. Log in to DAWeb on your node.
2. Go to the "Eingelieferte Objekte (AIP)" section.
3. Search your object by filtering for it by object identifier (which you take from the email).

1. To save resources, the system will remove the DIP automatically from the web share/UserArea 24h after you have downloaded it.

**Note** that requested packages are visible not only on the "Objekt entnehmen (DIP)" view but also in the outgoing folder of the contractors web share.
