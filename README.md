DNSCore
=======

The Core System of the DA-NRW Software Suite. 
The DNS software relies
exclusively on existing open source software components to implement a
distributed, self-validating repository, allowing depositors a high degree of control over
the methods applied to individual objects submitted for preservation and
distribution.
